## 📌 About the Project

Artisan Link is a hybrid business model that promotes handmade, traditional, and sustainable art forms. It operates through both an online marketplace and pop-up exhibitions to offer artisans a platform to sell their creations and tell their stories.

Our key pillars:
- **Empowerment:** Highlighting artisan stories and cultural heritage.
- **Accessibility:** Blending tech with tradition for ease of discovery and connection.
- **Community:** Creating networks among artisans, buyers, and enthusiasts.
